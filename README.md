# CalisFit

CalisFit is an App that gives users the ability to share their Calisthenics work out videos. Users are able to check in and out of Locations (Gyms/Crossfit Gyms/ Calisthenic Parks) 

### Frameworks

AVFoundations,
UserNotifications,
MapKit/Core Location

## Main Goal

Goal is to form a little Calisthenic Community where people can share their videos (progress videos) and receive positive feedback by others. A place where users  can meet other people near them for the chance to find work out buddies. 


### Motivation 
As someone that loves to do Calisthenics, I want to provide people that are barely starting out/people who are already in their journy an oportunity to meet other people that have the same interest. 

Four years ago when I had recently became interested in Calisthenic I wish I could have found an app that provided this. I did not know anyone that had the same passion as me, nor knew of gyms that provided the equipment nessesary to do the type of work outs. On top of that, I never had the chance to share my progress with anyone to get feed back on my form/work outs.
